Harnessing Data to Safeguard Our Seas

Project Steps

1. Data Collection and Cleaning:
  Obtain historical data on fish populations, fishing activities, environmental factors, and other relevant variables.
  Possible data sources:
    *	FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) - They maintain a comprehensive database of information on many aspects of fisheries and aquaculture, including fish stocks.
    *	ICES (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea) - This organization provides fish stock assessment data, some of which is publicly accessible on their ICES Data Portal.
    *	RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database - This is a compilation of stock assessment results for commercially exploited marine populations from around the world. 
    *	FishBase - This is a global database with information on practically all fish species known to science.
2. Data Analysis and Feature Engineering:
  Explore the data to understand the patterns and relationships between variables.
  Engineer features for the machine learning models based on findings from the data analysis.
3. Development of Predictive Model:
  Choose appropriate model (or models) for predicting future fish populations.
  Train and validate the model using preprocessed data.
  Fine-tune the model to achieve the best performance.
4. Development of Risk Assessment Model:
  Develop a model to predict high-risk areas based on historical data.
  Train, validate, and fine-tune this model as well.
5. Integration of Models into a Dashboard:
  Design and build a user-friendly dashboard.
  Integrate models so users can interactively adjust parameters and see the results.
  Make sure to visualize the results in an intuitive way (e.g., maps, charts).
6. Testing:
  Conduct thorough testing of the dashboard and the models.
  Ensure that the dashboard works correctly and provides accurate information.
7. Documentation and Presentation:
  Documenting our work process, the choices we made, the performance of our models, etc.
  Prepare a presentation to showcase the project, explain how to use the dashboard, and discuss findings.
