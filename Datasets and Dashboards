- shows apparent fishing effort using vessel monitoring and automatic identification
- "Global Fishing Watch uses data about a vessel’s identity, type, location, speed, direction and more that is broadcast using the Automatic Identification System (AIS) 
and collected via satellites and terrestrial receivers. AIS was developed for
safety/collision-avoidance. Global Fishing Watch analyzes AIS data collected 
from vessels that our research has identified as known or possible commercial
fishing vessels, and applies a fishing presence algorithm to determine 
“apparent fishing activity” based on changes in vessel speed and direction."
- uses MPA reference layers from World Database on Protected Areas
